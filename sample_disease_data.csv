Beans,Black root rot,Thielaviopsis basicola,Fungus,"Elongated red-purple lesions on root tissue which turns dark gray to black; lesions coalesce to form large dark areas on roots and stems; deep lesions can cause stunted growth, wilting leaves, defoliation and plant death.",Rotate crops with non-susceptible grasses; avoid excess irrigation or drought stress.,Fungus survive in plant debris in soil.
Mango,Pink disease,Erythricium salmonicolor,Fungus,"White, silk-like threads at forks of branches which coalesce to form a pink crust during wet conditions; twigs and branches above this site may be killed and foliage will begin to dry out and die; orange pustules may be present on infected bark",If pink disease is identified the recommended treatment is an application of an appropriate fungicide which can be applied by spraying or painting onto infected bark with a paintbrush,Pink disease is a destructive disease of mango grown in the wet tropics
Cocoa,Witches' broom,Moniliophthora perniciosa,Fungus,Characteristic proliferation of shoots and brooms from bud; production of branches which do not produce fruit; distorted pods with green patches which give an appearance of uneven ripening.,Good sanitation is the most effective method of controlling the disease; material known to be infected should be removed and destroyed; removal of infected material can be difficult as there may be no visible symptoms; new fungicides and resistant cocoa varieties are being developed to help control the disease.,"One of the most devastating cocoa diseases in South America; disease is widespread throughout South America, the Caribbean and Panama; spread of disease greatly influenced by humidity with emergence favored by high temperature and high humidity (>80%)."
Okra,Southern blight,Sclerotium rolfsii,Fungus,Sudden wilting of leaves; yellowing foliage; browning stem above and below soil; browning branches; stem may be covered with fan-like mycelial mat,Remove infected plants; avoid overcrowding plants to promote air circulation; rotate crops with less susceptible plants; plow crop debris deep into soil; provide a barrier to infection by wrapping lower stems of plant with aluminum foil covering below ground portion of stem and 2-3 in above soil line,"Fungus can survive in soil for long periods; disease emergence favored by high temperatures, high humidity and acidic soil; disease found mainly in tropical and subtropical regions, including the southern United States"
Oil palm,Ganoderma butt rot,Ganoderma,Fungi,"Reduced growth of palm, pale green foliage, older fronds turning chlorotic or necrotic; drooping fronds; on mature oil palms, spear leaves do not open, seedlings may exhibit a one-sided chlorosis or necrosis of the lower fronds; cross-sections of lower portion of trunk reveal a discoloration and softening of the central area and a distinct boundary is present between healthy and diseased tissue","There are currently no fungicides recommended for protecting palms from Ganoderma butt rot; palms should be monitored closely for signs of disease, especially if a palm has died or been removed nearby as fungi can colonize old stumps and release spores; infected trees should be removed as once symptoms are present in foliage, a large portion of the trunk is already rotted and the palm is unstable; do not replant palm in soil where an infected palm has been removed",Serious disease in Far East
Onion,Botrytis leaf blight,Botrytis squamosa,Fungus,Small white lesions with light green halos which may expand slightly as they age; in prolonged periods of moisture fungus may develop rapidly and cause leaf blighting,Plant onions in single rows allowing at least 30 cm between plants to promote good air circulation and quick drying of foliage after rain; time irrigation to allow plants time to dry out sufficiently; apply appropriate fungicide sprays when plants have at least five true leaves and early symptoms of disease,Disease emergence favors high humidity and warm temperatures; fungus survives on piles of crop debris or in soil; older leaves more susceptible to blighting than younger leaves
Almond,Crown gall,Agrobacterium tumefaciens,Bacterium,Galls of various sizes on roots and root crown below the soil line; galls may occasionally grow on the trunk; galls are initially light colored bulges which grow larger and darken; galls may be soft and spongy or hard; if galling is severe and girdles the trunk then young trees are weakened due to constricted vascular tissue; trees may be stunted and rarely die,"Only plant disease-free nursery stock; plant trees in well-draining soils; avoid wounding the plants as much as possible; fresh wounds can be treated with a biocontrol agent (Agrobacterium tumefaciens K84), if available, to prevent the bacterium colonizing","The bacterium enters host plants through wounds and causes plant cells to proliferate and cells to be undifferentiated, leading to the formation of a gall"
Carrot,Cottony rot (Sclerotinia rot),Sclerotinia sclerotiorum,Fungus,"Small, water-soaked, soft lesions on crown and roots; white fluffy fungal growth all over affected tissues; soft and decaying tissue developing","Cultural practices play an important role in the control of cottony rot as there are no resistand carrot varieties: in carrot fields, the use of drip irrigation 5-8 cm below the soil surface can provide good control; deep plowing of soil and trimming back carrot foliage to promote air circulation can also be useful; fungicides may be warranted in periods of extended cool, damp weather",Fungus can survive in soil for up to 10 years; disease emergence is favored by soils that are held close to saturation for periods in excess of 2 weeks
Ginger,Chinese rose beetle,Adoretus sinicus,Insect,"""Shot-hole"" appearance of leaves; entire leaf consumed with the exception of the leaf veins; adult insect is a reddish-brown beetle which feeds on plants at night.","Chinese rose beetles are attracted to dim light and repelled by bright light, shining bright light on plants may help deter them from feeding; covering young plants with e.g. floating row covers can help to protect plants until they are old enough to withstand attacks by the beetle.",Chinese rose beetles are nocturnal.
Orange,Blast,Pseudomonas syringae,Bacterium,Water-soaked or black lesions on leaf petioles;which rapidly expand along the leif midrib; cankers on twigs and branches; twigs may be girdles and die; leaves turning black and dying; black lesions may be present on fruit,"In areas where disease is severe, copper fungicides should be applied in Fall and WInter prior to the first rains",Symptoms most severe on south facing side of tree exposed to winds
Pawpaw,Black rot,Mycosphaerella caricae,Fungus,"Black sunken rot on young fruits originating from stem end or contact with a leaf; young fruit withering and dropping from plant; small, brown sunken lesions with light brown margins on ripening fruit.",Appropriate protective fungicides should be applied; dipping fruits in hot water at 48Â°C for 20 minutes reduces the incidence of the disease.,Fungi enters fruit through wounds.
Plantain,Rhizome rot,Erwinia carotovora,Bacteria,Pseudostem breaks from rhizome; rhizome will not germinate; internal tissue yellow/brown and watery,"Select only high quality, disease-free rhizomes fro propagation; disinfect all tools used for propagation regularly; allow seed pieces to dry before planting","Bacteria live in soil and enter plant through wounds; disease encouraged by wet, humid conditions"
Rice,Leaf scald,Microdochium oryzae,Fungus,As name suggest we will see scalded appearance on leaves. The lesion is marked with different zone from alternating light tan and dark brown from leaf tips or edges. As the leaves mature the lesion is with light brown halos. Margins and leaf tips are translucent.,Grow resistant varieties. Treat the seeds with suitable fungicide. Apply only recommended quantity of nitrogen fertilizer in split dose.,"The symptoms may vary depends on cultivar, growth stage and plant density. The disease is severe in Latin America and West Africa."
